\arguments{
\item{step}{A vector of steps}

\item{incidence}{A matrix (n trajectories x n steps) of incidence counts}

\item{p}{A single \code{\link[=carehomes_parameters]{carehomes_parameters()}} object.}

\item{sliding_window_ndays}{An integer giving the length of the sliding
window on which Rt will be estimated}

\item{mean_prior}{The mean prior for Rt}

\item{sd_prior}{The standard deviation of the prior for Rt}

\item{n_GT}{An integer giving the number of generation times to be drawn to
construct the discrete distribution of the generation time}

\item{n_R}{An integer giving the number of Rt values to sample from for each
incidence trajectory. These will then be aggregated across all incidence
trajectories.}

\item{save_all_Rt_sample}{A boolean determining whether to save all samples
of Rt estimated or only a summary}

\item{q}{A vector of quantiles to return values for}
}
\value{
A list with elements
\code{t_start} (vector of first days of the sliding windows over which Rt is
estimated),
\code{t_end} (vector of last days of the sliding windows over which Rt is
estimated),
\code{Rt} a matrix (only present if \code{save_all = TRUE}) containing for each
sliding window (each col in the matrix) a sample of n_R * nrow(inc) values
of Rt for that sliding window (rows of the matrix)
\code{Rt_summary} a matrix containing for each sliding window (each col in the
matrix) the quantiles (\code{q}) and the mean of Rt for that sliding
window (rows of the matrix)
}
\description{
Compute "Rt" using EpiEtim for a set of simulated trajectories (e.g., the
result of the \verb{$iterate()} method of \link{carehomes}, \code{\link[mcstate:pmcmc]{mcstate::pmcmc()}} or
\code{\link[mcstate:pmcmc_predict]{mcstate::pmcmc_predict()}}. The trajectories should share
parameters.
