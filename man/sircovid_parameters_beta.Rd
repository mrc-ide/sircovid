\title{Construct beta array}
\usage{
sircovid_parameters_beta(date, value, dt)
}
\arguments{
\item{date}{Either \code{NULL}, if one value of beta will be used for
all time steps, or a vector of times that will be used as change
points. Must be provided as a \code{\link[=sircovid_date]{sircovid_date()}}, i.e., days into
2020.}

\item{value}{Either a vector of values to use for beta - either a scalar
(if \code{date} is \code{NULL}) or a vector the same length as \code{date}. Or a matrix
with number of rows equal to length of \code{date} and number of columns equal
to number of strains.}

\item{dt}{The timestep that will be used in the simulation. This
must be of the form \code{1 / n} where \code{n} is an integer representing
the number of steps per day. Ordinarily this is set by sircovid
internally to be \code{0.25} but this will become tuneable in a
future version.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of beta values, one per timestep, until
the beta values stabilise.  After this point beta is assumed to
be constant.
}
\description{
Construct the \code{beta} (contact rate) over time array for use within
sircovid models.
}
\examples{
# If "date" is NULL, then beta is constant and this function is
# trivial:
sircovid::sircovid_parameters_beta(NULL, 0.1, 0.25)

date <- sircovid::sircovid_date(
   c("2020-02-01", "2020-02-14", "2020-03-15"))
value <- c(3, 1, 2)
beta <- sircovid::sircovid_parameters_beta(date, value, 1)

# The implied time series looks like this:
t <- seq(0, date[[3]])
plot(t, beta, type = "o")
points(date, value, pch = 19, col = "red")

# After 2020-03-15, the beta value will be fixed at 2, the value
# that it reached at that date.

# You can see this using sircovid_parameters_beta_expand
# If a vector of dates is provided then, it's more complex. We'll
# use dt of 1 here as it's easier to visualise
t <- seq(0, 100, by = 1)
sircovid::sircovid_parameters_beta_expand(t, beta)
plot(t, sircovid::sircovid_parameters_beta_expand(t, beta), type = "o")
points(date, value, pch = 19, col = "red")

# If dt is less than 1, this is scaled, but the pattern of beta
# change is the same
beta <- sircovid::sircovid_parameters_beta(date, value, 0.5)
t <- seq(0, date[[3]], by = 0.5)
plot(t, beta, type = "o", cex = 0.25)
points(date, value, pch = 19, col = "red")
