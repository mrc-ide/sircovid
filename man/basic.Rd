\title{The basic sircovid model}
\description{
The "basic" sircovid model. This is a dust model.
}
\examples{
# Set up the basic model for England with default parameters and
# an initial seeding of early February:
p <- basic_parameters(sircovid_date("2020-02-07"), "england")
mod <- basic$new(p, 0, 10)

# Set the initial state and index as we would us for a run
# (without setting an initial state there is no seeding)
initial <- basic_initial(mod$info(), 10, p)
mod$update_state(state = initial)
mod$set_index(basic_index(mod$info())$run)

# Run the model up to the end of march
step_end <- sircovid_date("2020-03-31") / p$dt

# The filtered state is returned at the end of the run
mod$run(step_end)

# More state can be retrieved using the "state" method
mod$state(1:6)
}
