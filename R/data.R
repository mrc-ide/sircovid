##' Convert data into mcstate format; this is a thin wrapper around
##' [mcstate::particle_filter_data()] which adds a dummy step in front
##' of the first data point so that we can use the previous state and
##' the current states to convert cumulative measures into net daily
##' changes.
##'
##' @title Prepare data for mcstate
##'
##' @param data A `data.frame` object suitable for
##'   [mcstate::particle_filter_data()]
##'
##' @param start_date The start date, as a [sircovid_date()], R "Date"
##'   object or a string in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
##'
##' @param dt The time step (fraction of a day that each step
##'   represents) as used to create the model object
##'
##' @param expected Optional list of expected column names and types
##'   that are expected (use `NA_real_`). These will be filled in with
##'   the value where missing.
##'
##' @return A data.frame suitable for use with `mcstate` functions
##'   such as [mcstate::particle_filter()] and [mcstate::pmcmc()]

##' # A data sert that has data from the first of February to the first of
##' # March (one column of data called 'x')

  ## To make this work, we've manually inserted a fake reporting
  ## period at the first row of the file so that our compare works
  ## correctly; this should be something that mcstate can do for us.
