Description: Mechanistic models of transmission of the SARS-Cov-2 (COVID-19)
    virus implemented as stochastic compartmental models in odin and
    dust. Uses mcstate to perfom Bayesian evidence synthesis from
    several surveillance data streams through the estimation of
    transmission parameters.
